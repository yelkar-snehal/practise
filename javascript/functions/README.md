Question 1: Function Code
Explanation: This code defines a function square that calculates the square of a number and a function displaySquare that logs the square of 5 using the square function.

Question 2: What is IIFE?
Explanation: IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. Example 1 shows a simple IIFE, while Example 2 demonstrates an IIFE with nested functions.

Question 3: Closure
Explanation: The code demonstrates closure where the inner function displayName has access to the variable name defined in the outer function init.

Question 4: Function Scope
Explanation: This code showcases function scope and variable shadowing. In Q-1, the mul function uses the variables num1 and num2 from the global scope. In Q-2, the setTimeout function inside a loop creates a closure but uses the global i variable.

Question 5: Function Hoisting
Explanation: Function hoisting allows calling a function before it is declared. The code demonstrates hoisting with a function declaration and how it behaves differently from non-hoisted functions.

Question 6: Params vs. Arguments
Explanation: This code defines a function fn with parameters a, x, y, and a rest parameter numbers, showcasing how parameters are declared and used in functions.

Question 7: Spread operator and rest operator
Explanation: The code shows the usage of the rest parameter in a function declaration and the spread operator to pass an array as individual arguments to the function.

Question 8: Callback
Explanation: This code demonstrates a callback function greeting being passed as an argument to the processUserInput function, allowing dynamic behavior based on user input.

Question 9: Arrow functions
Explanation: Arrow functions are shown in two forms: one with explicit return and braces, and another with implicit return when the function body is a single expression.

Question 10: this
Explanation: The code defines an object user with methods rc1 and rc2. rc1 uses an arrow function, resulting in this referring to the global object, while rc2 uses a regular function, allowing this to refer to the object itself.
