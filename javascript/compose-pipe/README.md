Question: What is the purpose of the compose and pipe functions in JavaScript?

Explanation:
- compose and pipe are higher-order functions used for function composition in JavaScript.
- compose takes multiple functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies these functions from right to left.
- pipe, on the other hand, applies the functions from left to right.
- Both compose and pipe are commonly used in functional programming to create new functions by combining existing ones in a specific order.
