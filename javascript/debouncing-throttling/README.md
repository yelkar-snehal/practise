Question: How does the JavaScript code implement debounce functionality for button clicks?
Explanation: The JavaScript code uses lodash's _.debounce function to create a debounced version of a callback function. It tracks the number of times a button is pressed and updates the count after a specified debounce time (800ms in this case).

Question: How does the JavaScript code implement throttle functionality for button clicks?
Explanation: The JavaScript code uses lodash's _.throttle function to create a throttled version of a callback function. It tracks the number of times a button is pressed and updates the count at intervals of 1000ms, ensuring that the callback function is not invoked more than once in that interval.

Question: What is the purpose of the JavaScript code for a custom debounce function (polyfill)?
Explanation: The JavaScript code defines a custom debounce function myDebounce that mimics the behavior of lodash's _.debounce. It creates a debounced version of a callback function and ensures that the callback is executed only after a specified debounce time (800ms in this case) since the last invocation.

Question: What is the purpose of the JavaScript code for a custom throttle function (polyfill)?
Explanation: The JavaScript code defines a custom throttle function myThrottle that mimics the behavior of lodash's _.throttle. It creates a throttled version of a callback function and ensures that the callback is invoked at most once per specified interval (1000ms in this case), preventing rapid successive invocations.
